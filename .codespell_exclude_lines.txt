Approaches for Working with Azure AKS
You can approach running workloads in Azure AKS with NVIDIA GPUs in at least two ways.
Default AKS configuration without the GPU Operator
By default, you can run Azure AKS images on GPU-enabled virtual machines with NVIDIA GPUs,
AKS images include a preinstalled NVIDIA GPU Driver and preinstalled NVIDIA Container Toolkit.

The images that are available in AKS always include a preinstalled NVIDIA GPU driver
After you start your Azure AKS cluster, you are ready to install the NVIDIA GPU Operator.
